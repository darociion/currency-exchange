# Currency-Exchange (Alura - ONE Java Back-End Challenge)

This repository contains the Java Back-End solution to the challenge proposed in the [Alura Latam](https://github.com/alura-es-cursos) / Oracle Java Back-End course, part of the ONE program. The challenge involves creating a currency exchange application that consumes the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to retrieve conversion rates and perform currency conversions based on user input.

## How to Use :page_facing_up:

1. First, select an option to start the program. In this example, option 9 (USD) is selected.
